## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 👤 Admin User Management
- **Get All Users**  
  Endpoint to fetch the complete user list.
- **Get Single User Details**  
  Fetch user details by ID with validation.

  Admin can update a user’s role (`user` ↔ `admin`) with validation.  
- **Delete User**  
  Admin can remove a user permanently by ID.

### ⭐ Product Review System
- **Create / Update Review**  
  - If a user already reviewed a product → update rating & comment.  
  - If new → push a fresh review with user details.  
- **Auto Calculation**  
  - Updates `numOfReviews` dynamically.  
  - Computes average rating (`ratings`) after every review.  
- **Validation Handling**  
  - Used `validateBeforeSave: false` to avoid full-schema validation issues on partial updates.

### 📦 Product Management
- **Admin Get All Products**  
  Admin-only endpoint to fetch all product details from the database.

## 🛠️ Code Improvements
- Centralized API response using `ApiResponse` class.

- Reused `asynchandler` for async/await error handling.  
- Safe DB operations with mongoose options (`new: true`, `runValidators: true`).
