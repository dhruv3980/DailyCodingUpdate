Today’s focus was on strengthening **User Account Management** by implementing essential controllers for authentication and profile handling.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🔑 1. Reset Password
- Handles password reset using a secure `token`.
- Verifies the token’s validity and expiry time.
- Allows the user to set a new password (with confirm check).
- Clears the reset token and expiry after successful reset.
- Automatically re-authenticates the user with a fresh JWT.

---

### 👤 2. Get User Profile
- Fetches details of the currently logged-in user.
- Uses the authenticated `req.user.id`.
- Returns profile details with proper error handling.

---

### 🔒 3. Change Password
- Validates old password using bcrypt comparison.
- Ensures **new password ≠ old password**.
- Checks that `newPassword === confirmPassword`.
- Updates the password securely (hashed via pre-save hook).
- Returns success message after update.

---

### ✏️ 4. Update User Profile
- Allows user to update `name` and/or `email`.
- Uses `findByIdAndUpdate` with:
  - `new: true` → returns updated user object.
  - `runValidators: true` → ensures schema validation rules are applied.
- Prevents overwriting with `undefined` values.
- Returns updated user profile in the response.

---

## ⚡ Improvements in Error Handling
- Replaced wrong status codes (`401`) with more meaningful ones like `400` (Bad Request) and `404` (Not Found).
- Added descriptive messages for validation errors (e.g., password mismatch, expired token).
